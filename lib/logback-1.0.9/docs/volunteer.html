    <h2>Call for volunteers</h2>

    <p>We are looking for volunteers in the following areas.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><span class="label">top priority</span> <b>logback in 10 minutes</b> 
      
      <p>We are looking for a volunteer to write a short document
      describing logback for beginners, entitled say "logback in 10
      minutes". This document is likely to be the most widely read
      document of the project. Writing such a document is an excellent
      opportunity to learn logback. Obviously, there would be plenty
      of editorial help and guidance coming from the logback
      developers.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><span class="label">high priority</span> <b>Maintain the groovy configurator</b>

      <p>The Groovy configurator, aka Gaffer, although pretty cool, is
      not getting the attention it deserves. The amount of code
      involved, altough not completely trivial, is far from
      insurmountable. We are looking for a volunteer to take over
      Gaffer.
       </p>
      </li>

      <li><b>Write a tool for parsing log files</b>

        <p>We are looking for a volunteer to write a tool for parsing
        log files.</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>Improve OSGi support</b>
      
      <p>We are looking for an OSGi expert to review our current
      practices and improve OSGi support in logback.  </p></li>
      
      <li><b>Fixing bugs</b>

      <p>We are looking for volunteers for fixing logback
      bugs. Volunteering to solve bugs is a good way to learn about
      any project.
      </p>      
      </li>

      <li><span class="label">high priority</span> <b>Proof reading the documentation</b>
      <p>We are always looking for volunteers to proof-read the
      documentation. Suggestions as to the design and look-and-feel of
      the site are also welcome.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>>If you wish to contribute to the project or just hack for fun,
    you will probably want to import logback as a project into your
    favorite IDE. See the instructions for <a
    href="setup.html#ide">building logback in Eclipse or IntelliJ
    IDEA</a> for details.</p>
